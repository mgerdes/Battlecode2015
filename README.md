Macro Strategy Ideas
--------------------
* Defend and try to win via tiebreaker
* Win by destroying enemy HQ
* Waste enemy resources by destroying buildings and pestering miners
* Build units that best respond to opponents units
* Use towers for distributed algorithms?
* Use scout units (that may die) to see what buildings enemy has

Micro Strategy Ideas
--------------------
* Use robots with greater range than enemy and quickly move away after attacking
* Avoid clustering when facing enemy weapons that have proximity damage
* Find optimal mixes of robots to minimize weaknesses

Small map vs big map
