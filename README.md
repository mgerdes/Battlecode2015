### Strategy Summary: justInTime

#### Justification of units
##### Drones
Even after release 1.1, drones are a great unit. They are a fast and can fly over all terrains. This makes them effective at surveying territory and moving supplies across the map. They are also useful for pestering enemy miners and beavers. They are built from the Helipad, which is needed for Launchers
##### Launchers
The spash damage from the missiles is effective against large clumps of units. Many bots will be using large clumps of units, especially mid/late game. These launchers will help take out masses of units quickly.
##### Soldiers
These are the cheapest and quickest fighting unit. They match the drone's range, so they are effective at defending from early drone rushes. If a quick rush comes, they can be produced quickly for defense.

#### Building order
* Miner Factory
* Helipad
* Barracks
* Aerospace lab

#### Early Game
* Building around 10 drones to pester enemy miners and beavers
* Have one drone survey the map
* Use towers to watch for incoming enemies
* Build around 20 soldiers to defend the miners

#### Mid Game
* Build launchers, soldiers, and drones
* Move units into position

#### End Game
* Attack with launchers in the front line
* Use drones for a flank attack. Take out miners or an unguarded tower.
