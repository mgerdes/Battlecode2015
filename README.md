### Brainstorming...
#### Macro Strategy Ideas
* Waste enemy resources by destroying buildings and pestering miners
* Build units that best respond to opponents units
* Use towers for distributed algorithms?
* Adjust strategy depending on opponents units/buildings?

#### Micro Strategy Ideas
* Avoid clustering when facing enemy weapons that have proximity damage
* Find optimal mixes of robots
* Attack the enemy robot that will die first (lower HP, less armor, etc...)
* Transfer supplies from a unit before it dies

#### Small map vs big map
* Harder to rush on big map

#### Tower count
* Fewer towers will be shorter game
* Easier to attack HQ

#### Overall Ore Amount in Map
* Less Ore ---> fewer building and fewer miners

#### Uses for spare bytecodes
* Broadcast bug paths (towers can potentially do this)
* Optimize bug paths that have been broadcast
