### Strategy Ideas for Qualifying/Seeding Tournament

#### Justification of units
##### Drones
Drones can still be used for an early swarm or for pestering, but only in certain situations. The distance between the HQ needs to be small, and the towers need to be far enough apart that units can pass through. Drones are still valuable for surveying and supply, but other units can take on these roles. Other units cannot survey over VOID patches, but this level or accuracy is not always valuable. The weakening of launchers has also made drones weaker. If we do not use launchers, there is no need for the Helipad.
##### Launchers
After the 1.2 release, launchers have been considerably weakened. When they are carrying 6 missiles, they can deal a lot of damage in a short period. When they are out of missiles, they are a pretty weak unit, only generating a missile every 8 turns (2.25 damage / turn). Managing missile count will be critical to using launchers, and noticing missile count will be very helpful in defending against launchers.
##### Soldiers
Soldiers have become the bread and butter fighting unit. They will have value in early game as pestering units and defending from rushes. In later game, they are very well paired with launchers and tanks.
Their quick and weak attack is a good counter against missiles, because a missile will blow up after three shots. When fighting launchers, the soldiers can focus on the missiles until the launchers have a low missile supply, then they can move into close range and finish off the launchers.
#### Tanks
Tanks are pretty nice. When grouped with soldiers, they can effectively counter launchers.
